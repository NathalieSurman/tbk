                <p>This was Cassini’s view from orbit around Saturn on Jan. 2, 2010. In this image, the rings on the night side of the planet have been brightened significantly to more clearly reveal their features. On the day side, the rings are illuminated both by direct sunlight, and by light reflected off Saturn’s cloud tops.</p>
              <p>This natural-color view is a composite of images taken in visible light with the Cassini spacecraft’s narrow-angle camera at a distance of approximately 1.4 million miles (2.3 million kilometers) from Saturn.</p>

                <h2>Peering Through Titan's Haze</h2>
                <p>This composite image shows an infrared view of Saturn's moon Titan from NASA's Cassini spacecraft,
                   acquired during the mission's "T-114" flyby on Nov. 13, 2015. The spacecraft's visual and infrared mapping spectrometer 
                   (VIMS) instrument made these observations, in which blue represents wavelengths centered at 1.3 microns,
                    green represents 2.0 microns, and red represents 5.0 microns. A view at visible wavelengths (centered around 0.5 microns)
                     would show only Titan's hazy atmosphere (as in PIA14909). The near-infrared wavelengths in this image allow Cassini's vision 
                     to penetrate the haze and reveal the moon's surface.</p>
              <p>During this Titan flyby, the spacecraft's closest-approach altitude was 6,200 miles (10,000 kilometers), 
                which is considerably higher than those of typical flybys, which are around 750 miles (1,200 kilometers). '
                The high flyby allowed VIMS to gather moderate-resolution views over wide areas (typically at a few kilometers per pixel).</p>
