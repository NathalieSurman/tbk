        No, but paddlers with limited/no paddling experience will only be permitted on calm days, 
  will be given 10-15 minutes on-land instruction and must demonstrate key skills in our bay before heading out for a paddle.

        Of course you can. However, if you are a group of paddlers we may have a difficult time accommodating you on weekday evenings
  and on weekends when we get busy so we strongly recommend making a reservation.

        Yes but the paddler must be experienced and must request a "Regular" kayak.
    Our "Small" kayaks and "tandem" kayaks are not suitable for dog passengers.
    Please also note that we do not supply dog life-jackets. Dogs do not need to sign a waiver ðŸ˜‰!
